# Disc City

Here the idea of a city as a disc is addressed.  That is, if "trips" are just distances between pairs of points in a city, what is the distribution of trip lengths if we repeatedly:

- choose two points - a "start" and a "destination" in a circular disc
- measure the distance between them

The resulting distribution of trip lengths does not appear to be a heavy-tailed whatsoever. 

What if we modify it a bit and choose the two points from a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution (perhaps a first-order approximation to the density of start- and end-points in urban trips)?
